# Minigame library
## Nicolas Morales-Sanabria

This project is a minigame library, the library allows the player to access different games through menus and also runs a main game that makes multiple games interact with each other. The games included consist of all the exercices made throughout the semester in addition, there is a new game (the main game) that incorporates multiple games to create a new story using screenshots of code.

Note that the project also explored the creation of a p5 library, (p5.commonGameFunctions)
which is used to simplify the code for the games and avoid duplicate code.

This project uses 3 songs:
"The hand that feeds" by Nine Inch Nails
"Uprising" by Muse
"Bitter Sweet Symphony" by The Verve

Please note that the inclusion of these songs is for educational & non-commercial purposes. All credits and rights belong to their respective copyright holders.
